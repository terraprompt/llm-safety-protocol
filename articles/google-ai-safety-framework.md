# Google's AI Safety Framework

## Overview

Google's approach to AI safety emphasizes proactive risk assessment through their Frontier Safety Framework and Secure AI Framework (SAIF). These frameworks take a systematic approach to identifying Critical Capability Levels (CCLs) across multiple domains and integrating security measures throughout the ML pipeline.

## Key Components

### Frontier Safety Framework
- Proactive identification of Critical Capability Levels (CCLs)
- Focus areas: autonomy, biosecurity, cybersecurity, and ML R&D
- Early warning evaluations to detect approaching dangerous capabilities before they emerge
- Tiered mitigation strategies scaled to risk levels

### Secure AI Framework (SAIF)
- Integration of security measures throughout the ML pipeline
- Automated red teaming and 24/7 monitoring
- Comprehensive integration with Google's broader AI Principles

## Contrast with Other Approaches

Google's approach differs significantly from Anthropic's Constitutional AI in that it emphasizes prevention rather than response to AI safety risks. While Constitutional AI embeds safety principles directly into model behavior through training, Google's approach focuses on systematic risk assessment and monitoring.

Compared to Meta's multi-layered safety approach, Google's frameworks are more centralized and systematic, with formalized processes for risk identification and mitigation. Unlike OpenAI's Harmony Protocol (which focuses on communication structure), Google's frameworks address core safety concerns through comprehensive evaluation and monitoring systems.

## Technical Implementation

Google's frameworks include:
- Systematic evaluation of model capabilities across multiple risk domains
- Continuous monitoring systems for deployed models
- Automated red teaming processes to identify vulnerabilities
- Integration with existing AI development pipelines
